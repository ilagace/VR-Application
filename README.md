## VR Application for Architects

This Project is an experimental project to visualize in 3D new architectural designs against a street view (from Google).  It will allow a user to visualize the design in its final environment while walking around it using Cardboard or other VR devices. Designed for mobile devices.

It is based on threejs for the 3D rendering in VR plus google-panorama-equirectangular.  Requires browsersify.

Works well on all platforms and devices.
